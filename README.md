# Hello! What is this??
This is my custom-built static site generator that I use for [audreypenven.net](https://audreypenven.net). As is, this code's not usable to make your own website. The style and templating are very idiosycratically *mine*, and I haven't yet abstracted those details away.

I wanted to share this anyway, because long ago, I learned to make my own websites by seeing what others did and then trying it out for myself. 

As of this writing (2024.02.07), this code is missing a whole bunch of stuff that I haven't cleaned up enough to share. It's also completely missing any kind of explanation describing how this works, and how you might modify it for your own purposes. But, something's better than nothing, I guess!
